# ConvComMoji

An extension of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification that outlines possible use and application of emojis. It follows most of the original specification of Conventional Commits v1.0.0 defined [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification), but is more opinionated about what types should be used.
